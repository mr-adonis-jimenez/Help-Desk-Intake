# Security Policy for help-desk-intake

## Our Commitment to Security

The security of our `help-desk-intake` system is a top priority. We take the protection of our data and our users' information very seriously. We value the contributions of security researchers and the community in helping us maintain a secure environment.

If you have discovered a security vulnerability, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

## How to Report a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities using public GitHub issues.**

We use **GitHub's Private Vulnerability Reporting** feature to securely manage all reports. This ensures your findings are routed directly to the maintainers without being publicly exposed.

1.  Navigate to the main page of the `help-desk-intake` repository.
2.  Click the **"Security"** tab located under the repository name.
3.  In the left sidebar, click **"Report a vulnerability"**.
4.  Please provide a detailed report with as much information as possible, including:
    * A clear description of the vulnerability.
    * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue.
    * The potential impact of the vulnerability (e.g., data exposure, privilege escalation).
    * Any proof-of-concept (PoC) code or screenshots.

## Our Response

When you submit a private report, you can expect the following:

* **Acknowledgment:** We will do our best to acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours.
* **Investigation:** We will investigate the report to validate the vulnerability. We may ask for additional information if needed.
* **Updates:** We will provide you with periodic updates on our progress as we work to remediate the issue.
* **Recognition:** We are happy to provide public credit and acknowledgment to researchers who submit valid reports, once the vulnerability has been resolved.

## Supported Versions

We only provide security support for the latest version of the code on the **`main`** branch. Vulnerabilities found in older versions or unmerged branches will be considered out of scope unless they also affect `main`.

## Out-of-Scope Issues

The following types of issues are generally considered out of scope:

* Reports from automated scanners without a validated proof-of-concept.
* Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies (please report those to Dependabot or the upstream project).
* Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
* Social engineering or phishing.
* Issues related to GitHub's infrastructure (please report to GitHub's bug bounty program).

Thank you for helping us keep `help-desk-intake` secure.
